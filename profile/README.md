# OS Community

**OS Community** is a space for collaboration, learning, and mutual support. While open-source is a key focus, we also discuss a wide range of topics—like a big college group where friends help each other.

## What We Offer
- **Help & Guidance**: Whether it’s open source or everyday challenges, the community is here to help.  
- **Opportunities**: Share and explore job openings, internships, and more.  
- **Resources**: Learn together with shared materials, tools, and advice.  
- **Friendly Discussions**: Connect with peers and engage in meaningful conversations.
